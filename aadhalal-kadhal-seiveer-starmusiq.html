love</span>) is a novel by Sujatha Rangarajan.</p><p>Poornachandra Rao, the eldest in the group is a Mathematics Professor in a college. He is considered a genius and is called as 'Aris' (short for Aristotle) by his friends; He doesn't believe in marriage; he is lazy and messy, but he is genuinely caring. He indeed has knowledge about everything from music to books to birds to Zen philosophy.</p><p>Directed by Suseenthiran. With Santhosh Ramesh, Manisha Yadav, Poornima Jayaram, V. A love affair begins harmless, but it later turns out to be a huge problem for the pair. Alai Payum Nenjile Song Lyrics, Movie Name: Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer, Artists: Santhosh Ramesh and Manisha Yadav, Music Director: Yuvan Shankar Raja.</p><p>Krishnamurthy works for a pharma company that manufactures a few medicines that probably no one buys. He is often seen to be touring to market his products. He is called 'Kitta' by others.</p><p>Paarthasarathy or Paarsarathy, works as a typist in a government office is the only married member in the group, because of which he is affectionately called 'maama'(uncle). His wife works as a Tamil lecturer in Chengelpet whom he visits in the weekends.</p><p>Jolarpet Mohanarangam called as 'JoMo' is a copy-writer at an advertising agency. He is the hero of this story, if one can call him a hero! He is a very responsible, patient and an enduring person who can tolerate anything and never gets angry. In addition to his copy-writing work, he does a lot of chores for his boss because he is someone who can't say No to others!</p><p>These four guys live upstairs in a house which is owned by a widowed lady (who thinks these four guys are related to each other). Her daughter Shalini aka Linny who is in her late teens, is a smart girl except that she is weak in Mathematics. JoMo has promised the lady that he would convince Aris to teach her daughter Maths. Aris has been dodging this so far.</p><p>The story starts on one fine day when JoMo wakes up early in the morning, heats water to take a bath (which is instead used by Aris), polishes his shoes (and also maama's), prepares eggs and toast for everybody, reaches office on time (he is never late for work). He travels in the lift with a beautiful girl who turns out to be a model who is coming to his ad agency to shoot for a soap commercial. When JoMo is asked to go to the studio to help the ad film director with a few lines, he accidentally gets into a store room cum changing room, and accidentally sees this girl topless while she changes to a bath costume. He falls in love with her the very same moment. (If he did not fall in love with her in the lift.)</p><p>Abhilasha, the model, comes to him a little while later, it seems both their fathers are childhood friends, and her father now wants to meet JoMo. He gets a slight hint from her that this may be a marriage proposal. She tells that she would take him to her house two days later. JoMo is joyous! When he reaches home Kitta (who had been to Bangalore on his business tour) is back. Kitta has apparently fallen in love with a police officer in Bangalore, and has decided to marry her. He says that Kasturi (the police woman) will be visiting Chennai very soon. When JoMo tells everyone about Abhilasha, they all think that the possibility of a beautiful model marrying him is really lean. JoMo thinks so too, but he hopes all of them are wrong.</p><p>Meanwhile, Aris starts with Mathematics tuition for Linny, but he teaches so many other things along with Maths, like guitar and birds (yeah, actually real birds), and Zen philosophy and whatever he knows. Very soon, Linny becomes a disciple, admirer and adorer of Aris. Everybody realizes that this may lead to something more than just tuition, but Aris doesn't think so.</p><p>Abhilasha meets JoMo and takes him to her house, where he meets her father who was a freedom fighter. He is very old now and partially deaf. He talks about his two marriages and about his daughter, and then asks her Abhi to bring tea. A fat servant girl serves him tea and snacks and keeps smiling at him. The old man then asks him if he is okay to marry his daughter Abhi, JoMo is more than okay. The old man says he would talk to JoMo's father, and JoMo says that he would write him a letter too.</p><p>JoMo comes home as the happiest man, and still cannot believe his luck. He starts writing a letter to his father immediately but then realizes that he doesn't know Abhi's father's name. He goes to her place again and only the fat servant girl is at home. She thinks that he has come to meet her and then hugs a shocked JoMo. Abhi and her father arrive too and JoMo tells (a confused) Abhi that they should get a new servant after marriage (see, why Abhi is confused) and then leaves. A couple of days later, JoMo's father calls him in his office and asks him if he is sure of marrying his friend's daughter. JoMo delightedly says Yes.</p><img src='https://www.newtamilhits.com/movieimages/Mr.Nokia_B.jpg' alt='Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer Starmusiq' title='Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer Starmusiq' /><p>Back at the residence, Kitta informs that Kasturi would be coming to Chennai for karate training and she will stay with them. Maama is not happy with this since his wife Neela is coming to stay too, for the Pongal holidays. Kasturi arrives and starts staying with them, ignoring maama's protests and other guys' discomfort. Meanwhile, Aris's class with Linny is anything but Mathematics and the other guys think that she is falling in love with him, but Aris still refuses to see it.</p><p>When Abhilasha comes to meet JoMo with the wedding invitations, he is surprised to see that the bride's name is Abhirami, and asks her if her name was Abhirami. She says that her sister's name was Abhirami, and asks JoMo to stop joking. JoMo realizes that the 'fat servant girl' is the elder sister of Abhilasha, and the wedding is in ten days. When he tells her that she was the one he is in love with, she is shocked too. She says that she doesn't love him back. Now, that doesn't matter for JoMo. All he wants is the wedding to be stopped. She replies that it is too late and her father will be furious and would file a police complaint against him if he does that. She says that he has to marry Abhirami, unless he can find anyone else who can marry her. In that case, she will try to convince her father.</p><p>A distressed JoMo discusses the situation with his friends, Aris sees a matrimonial ad in the newspaper which says 'healthy unemployed brides wanted for a businessman'. Since Abhirami is really suitable for this, JoMo goes to talk to those people in Saligramam the next evening, there he meets two goon-type guys, and inquires about the groom. When they hear someone knocking at the door, one of the guys, who has a big nose, gives him a small paper and tells him to go to the airport in the evening, for whatever reasons they don't have time to let him know before they kind-of throw him out through the back door.</p><p>JoMo goes to his flat and shows this paper to his friends. It has a flight number written on it, but also it is a receipt of a locker in the airport. JoMo goes to the airport and meets the person in-charge of the lockers, thinking that he may be related to the 'groom', but he is only given a bag and shoved away from there. He leaves the bag in his house and goes to Saligramam, and meets the two guys (one of them is the big nose guy) who are very angry that JoMo doesn't have the bag. They ask him to come to a hotel the next morning with the bag to meet the groom.</p><p>The next morning, JoMo can't find the bag in the house, Kitta says that Kasturi has taken the bag to the karate class, but doesn't know about its contents. JoMo goes to the hotel empty-handed. He meets Abhilasha who has an interview for the receptionist job in the same hotel. Manna, the groom, and the big nose guy meet them and ask about the bag. JoMo replies that the bag is at his home, and then introduces Abhilasha to Manna and says that her elder sister is the bride. Manna says that they can all go to meet the bride now, and on the way asks JoMo to get fruits and sweets, when JoMo gets down from the car, they drive away with Abhilasha.</p><p>Confused and clueless why they left him, he goes to Abhi's house where he meets the 'other' Abhi, and runs for his life. He realizes that Abhilasha has been kidnapped and that he needs to return their bag to get her back. Worried, he reaches home and tells his friends what happened. The same moment, Linny arrives and confesses to Aris that she is in love with him, leaving him shocked. JoMo asks Kasturi about the bag/.</p><div>Retrieved from 'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adhalinaal_Kaadhal_Seiveer&amp;oldid=927443537'</div><table><tbody><tr><th colspan='2'>Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer</th></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Directed by</th><td>Suseenthiran</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Produced by</th><td>Thai Saravanan</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Written by</th><td>Clinton &amp; Suseendhiran<br /><small><b>(Dialogue)</b></small></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Screenplay by</th><td>Suseendharin<br />Nagarajan<br />Vijay Anand</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Story by</th><td>Suseendharin<br /><small><b>(Additional Story)</b></small><br />Lenin Bharathi<br /><small><b>(Original Story)</b></small></td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Starring</th><td>Santosh Ramesh<br />Manisha Yadav</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Music by</th><td>Yuvan Shankar Raja</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Cinematography</th><td>Soorya.A.R</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Edited by</th><td>Anthony</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'><div>Production<br />company </div></th></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Distributed by</th><td>Red Giant Movies</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'><div>Release date</div></th></tr><tr><th scope='row'><div>Running time</div></th><td>101 Minutes</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Country</th><td>India</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Language</th><td>Tamil</td></tr></tbody></table><p><i><b>Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer</b></i> (transl.<span> Therefore, Go Ahead and Love</span>) is a 2013 Indian Tamil languageromantic drama film directed by Suseenthiran.<sup>[1]</sup> It features debutant Santhosh Ramesh (Singanamala Ramesh's second son) and Manisha Yadav of <i>Vazhakku Enn 18/9</i> fame in the lead roles.<sup>[1]</sup> It is produced by Nallu Studios and music by Yuvan Shankar Raja.

Her mom relates the unused pads and her vomiting and her behavior and realizes that she is pregnant and then all hell breaks loose.</p><p>Shwetha's dad speaks to Karthik's dad along with few relatives, and they argue. Shwetha's family, being on the receiving end want to finish the problem by getting them married. But Karthik's dad is not interested since his reputation will be spoiled. So, the lovers plan to elope and while they are on the way, Shwetha changes her mind and tells that her parents will feel bad. Karthik on the other hand tells that his parents will not agree for them to be together. They argue a lot and that forms a rift between them, but still they choose to stay together and return home. The families continue to argue about the marriage, and then finally Karthik's parents agree, provided Shwetha aborts the baby. But she refuses telling that the sole evidence will be lost and then again Karthik's parents will not get them married. Karthik tries to convince her, but it only leads to another argument and Shwetha walks off leaving an irate Karthik behind.</p><p>The parents also argue about the marriage and when some relatives speak ill about Shwetha and her character, (that she has acted like a prostitute and so she must take money for her services and not ask for marriage) Shwetha's father gets insulted and he leaves the place in tears. When Shwetha's mom knows this, she fights with Karthik's parents in front of their house, but Karthik has now changed his mind about marrying Shwetha because of the previous argument and he doesn't care anymore and is selfish and stone faced even when her whole family is in tears in front of his house. That is when Shwetha too decides that she doesn't want to be with Karthik anymore. And they leave his place.</p><p>Finally,a few months later a baby boy is born and Shwetha's dad leaves him in an orphanage. Two years later, we find that Shwetha is happily getting engaged to someone else, while Karthik is busy in a coffee shop flirting with another girl and the little child grows up in the orphanage without parental love and care.</p><h2><span>Cast</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><ul><li>Santhosh Ramesh as Karthik</li><li>Manisha Yadav as Shwetha</li><li>Jayaprakash as Shweta's father</li><li>Thulasi as Shweta's mother</li><li>Poornima Jayaram as Karthi's mother</li><li>Varun as Karthik &amp; Shweta's friend</li><li>Ramnath Shetty as Karthi's father</li><li>Arjunan as Jai</li><li>Archana Raja as Genelia</li><li>Durga as Karthik's sister</li><li>Srinidhi Vasudevan as Radhi</li></ul><h2><span>Production</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p>After <i>Rajapattai</i>, which was based on a script by a friend, Suseenthiran went back to new scripts and chose <i>Aadhalaal Kadhal Seiveer</i>. 'This is a story that has never been explored before in Tamil cinema. You cannot classify this film as mainstream. The enormous impact of the script will be felt in the film’s second half', he said.<sup>[6]</sup> Santhosh, a third year Loyola College student, plays the hero, while Manisha Yadav, who played one of the leads in the critically acclaimed <i>Vazhakku Enn 18/9</i>, the heroine. Some students from both Loyola and MOP Vaishnav colleges have acted in the film. Actor Poornima Bhagyaraj makes a comeback with this film. Apart from her, actors Jayaprakash, Thulasi and Arjun, who played a commendable role in <i>Kadhalil Sodhapuvadhu Eppadi</i>, are the other three familiar faces in the cast. The rest are newcomers. For the film all artistes attended a two-month rehearsal.<sup>[6]</sup></p><h2 id='aadhalal-kadhal-seiveer-video-songs-free-download-starmusiq'>Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer Video Songs Free Download Starmusiq</h2><p>Suseenthiran came up with the script of <i>Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer</i> while chatting with a friend who was talking about one of his relatives, a college girl, who had fallen in love. 'As he discussed her story, several issues one would normally not associate with a couple in love emerged. The impact was such that I was prompted to make a movie out of the story,' says Suseenthiran.<sup>[6]</sup> Suseenthiran has convinced the young music director Yuvan Shankar Raja to appear in a music video for a song from the film.<sup>[7]</sup> Unlike most other films, this film's title will not be showcased at the beginning but at the end.<sup>[6]</sup></p><h2><span>Soundtrack</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><table><tbody><tr><th colspan='2'>Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer</th></tr><tr><th colspan='2'>Soundtrack album by </th></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Released</th><td>17 October 2012</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Recorded</th><td>2012</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Genre</th><td>Feature film soundtrack</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Language</th><td>Tamil</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Label</th><td>Sa Re Ga Ma</td></tr><tr><th scope='row'>Producer</th><td>Yuvan Shankar Raja</td></tr><tr><th colspan='2'>Yuvan Shankar Raja chronology</th></tr><tr><td colspan='2'><table><tbody><tr><td><i>Aadhi Bhagavan</i><br />(2012)</td><td><i><b>Aadhalal Kadhal Seiveer</b></i><br />(2012)</td><td><i>Moondru Per Moondru Kaadhal</i><br />(2012)</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The soundtrack of the film was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja.

Any story dealing with a social problem is either extremely preachy or overtly melodramatic, but what we get here is an intelligent output sans cliches. Kudos to the director for writing and narrating an impactful story'.<sup>[22]</sup> Behindwoods wrote, 'AKS is a 'slice of life' tale topped by a really impactful climax.
